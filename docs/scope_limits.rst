Scope and limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *pvcompare* model was developed during the H2020 project `GRECO <https://www.greco-project.eu/>`_ with the purpose of
analysing the integration of three innovative PV techologies, that are developed within the project, into energy systems
in comparsion to the state-of-the-art technology. These three technologies are

- contentrator-PV (CPV),
- a multi-junction of perovskite and silicon (PSI) and
- PV powered heat pumps and chillers.

Therefore, the model focuses on Photovoltaiks, while also including sector-coupling through heat pumps and chillers.
However, a shift of focus is possible and can easily integrated. Feel free to contribute and check out our `Contributing Guidelines <https://github.com/greco-project/pvcompare/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

More information on the scope and limitations will follow.
